Final Project Proposal


Sparks


        For my final I will be creating a spark renderer that will take in different conditions to create the sparks. I plan to have the sparks originate from the center of the screen and have a few color options as if different materials -iron, cobalt, manganese- were being used. I would also like to be able to modify the speed at which the sparks are created and their velocities. My stretch goal would probably be to get the sparks to bounce of a surface.


Week 1: References and Research. Spark pictures will be gathered, and THREE.js will be explored.


Week 2: Render a particle- spark.


Week 3: Add spark texture to particles. I will hope to have a working particle simulation at this stage.


Week 4: Add options to change the speed and spark color.


Week 5: Fine Tuning or Stretch goal of adding a colliding surface.


I will creating this in THREE.js
